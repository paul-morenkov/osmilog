# Osmilog
Osmilog is a circuit simulator application modeled after the [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) software. This is my first serious project written in Rust.
Osmilog can be run natively or compiled to WASM. You can run the demo version in the browser [here](https://paul-morenkov.github.io/osmilog)
